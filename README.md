# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

also these might work
```
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```


ie. Hardhat gets us setup with a basic hardhat environment and some basic solidity contracts
