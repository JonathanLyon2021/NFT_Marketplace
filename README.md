<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Implemented a NFT Marketplace based on a Decentralized Application using Next.js and Goerli testnet.The purpose of this application is to allow users to create digital assets (NFT's), and also afterwards they have the option to put those NFT's on the NFT Marketplace for purchasing. This project was written in JavaScript and Solidity.

## What I learned

This was my first time implementing Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Hardhat. Also deploying to the Goerli testnet network was kind of a first because I had already deployed smart contracts on Remix IDE using Goerli network, just never creating NFT's using ipfs. Deploying through Hardhat was a simple process.
